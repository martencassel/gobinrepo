Here’s a roadmap of **next features** that would make `gobinrepo` both more robust and more useful in real‑world environments. I’ll group them so you can see the natural progression:

---

### 🔧 Core Proxy Enhancements
- **Dynamic repoKey management API**:
  Add `POST /api/repos`, `GET /api/repos`, `DELETE /api/repos/:repoKey` so users can configure new upstream registries without code changes.
- **Registry compatibility**:
  Test and adapt for other major registries (GHCR, ECR, GCR, ACR). Each has quirks (auth flows, path conventions) that you’ll need to normalize like you did with Docker Hub’s `library/` prefix.
- **Authentication passthrough**:
  Support forwarding client credentials (basic auth, bearer tokens) to upstream registries. This is essential for private images.

---

### 📦 Caching & Storage
- **Configurable cache directory**:
  Allow `--cache-dir` flag instead of hard‑coding `/tmp/blobs`.
- **Eviction policies**:
  Implement LRU or TTL‑based cleanup to prevent unbounded disk growth.
- **Cache metrics**:
  Track hit/miss counts per repoKey and expose via `/metrics` (Prometheus‑friendly).

---

### 🔍 Observability & Tracing
- **Structured request logging**:
  Include repoKey, upstream URL, cache hit/miss, latency.
- **RoundTripper tracer**:
  Wrap the HTTP client with a tracing `RoundTripper` that logs upstream requests/responses, headers, and timing. This helps debug CDN/proxy compatibility.
- **Distributed tracing hooks**:
  Add OpenTelemetry spans around cache lookup, upstream fetch, and blob streaming.

---

### 🌐 CDN & Network Compatibility
- **CDN‑aware RoundTripper**:
  Verify that responses are cacheable by CDNs (check `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Range` support).
  Add a tracer that records whether upstream responses are CDN‑friendly.
- **Range request support**:
  Some clients and CDNs fetch blobs in chunks. Supporting `Range` headers makes `gobinrepo` compatible with more tooling.

---

### 🛡️ Reliability & Security
- **Graceful shutdown**:
  Ensure in‑flight blob writes are completed or rolled back cleanly.
- **TLS termination**:
  Add optional HTTPS support with configurable certs.
- **Access control**:
  Restrict which repoKeys can be used, or require auth for the management API.

---

### 🚀 Developer Experience
- **Better error messages**:
  Surface upstream errors clearly to the client.
- **Integration tests**:
  Spin up fake registries (e.g. using `oras` or `registry:2` container) to validate proxy behavior end‑to‑end.
- **README improvements**:
  Document the `library/` normalization rule for Docker Hub, and show examples for GHCR/Quay.

---

### 📈 Suggested Next Milestones
1. **Short‑term**: Dynamic repoKey API + structured logging + configurable cache dir.
2. **Mid‑term**: Auth passthrough + eviction policies + Prometheus metrics.
3. **Long‑term**: CDN compatibility checks + OpenTelemetry tracing + multi‑cloud registry support.

---

👉 If you want to prioritize developer value quickly, I’d start with **dynamic repoKey API** and **roundtripper tracing**. That gives you flexibility (no rebuilds for new registries) and visibility (you’ll know exactly what’s happening on the wire).

Do you want me to sketch a **tracing RoundTripper** implementation in Go (wrapping `http.RoundTripper` to log timing, headers, and status codes)? That would give you a plug‑and‑play observability building block.

----

If you want to build this out in a way that gives you confidence and momentum, the order matters. Here’s how I’d stage it:

---

### 1. **Upstream logging & tracing**
- Add a `RoundTripper` wrapper that logs every outbound request to the upstream registry: method, URL, headers, status code, latency.
- This gives you immediate visibility into what your proxy is actually doing on the wire.
- With that in place, you can quickly spot quirks (e.g. Docker Hub’s `library/` prefix, Quay’s auth redirects, GHCR’s token flow).
- It also lays the foundation for structured metrics and distributed tracing later.

👉 This is the lowest‑risk, highest‑value first step. You’ll know exactly how your proxy behaves and where compatibility issues arise.

---

### 2. **Compatibility / CDN testing**
- Once you can see the upstream traffic, you can start verifying whether responses are “CDN‑friendly”:
  - Do they return `Cache-Control` headers?
  - Do they support `Range` requests?
  - Are `ETag` and `If-None-Match` respected?
- You can build small probes/tests that fetch manifests and blobs, then check if the headers and status codes align with what a CDN would expect.
- This step ensures your proxy won’t break when fronted by a CDN or reverse proxy.

---

### 3. **Performance verification**
- With logging and compatibility validated, you can move on to measuring throughput and latency.
- Add timing metrics around cache hits vs. upstream fetches.
- Run load tests (e.g. `hey`, `wrk`, or `ab`) to measure how your proxy scales with concurrent pulls.
- This is where you can tune blob streaming, concurrency, and cache eviction.

---

### 🔑 Why this order
- **Logging first**: you can’t debug or measure what you can’t see.
- **Compatibility second**: once you see the traffic, you can validate correctness against registry/CDN expectations.
- **Performance last**: only makes sense once you’re confident the proxy is functionally correct and observable.

---

If you’d like, I can sketch a **minimal `TracingRoundTripper`** implementation in Go that you can drop in right now. That would give you structured logs of every upstream request/response, which is the perfect starting point. Would you like me to draft that?
