### Core proxy improvements
- Dynamic repoKey management: provide a small management API (POST /api/repos, GET /api/repos, DELETE /api/repos/:repoKey) so new upstream registries can be added at runtime.
- Registry compatibility: test and adapt behavior for other registries (GHCR, ECR, GCR, ACR). Each has slightly different auth or path conventions (for example, Docker Hub’s implicit `library/`), so account for those differences.
- Auth passthrough: forward client credentials (basic auth, bearer tokens) to upstream registries for private images.

### Caching and storage
- Configurable cache directory: add a `--cache-dir` flag instead of using a hardcoded `/tmp/blobs`.
- Eviction policies: implement LRU or TTL cleanup to avoid unbounded disk growth.
- Cache metrics: expose per-repoKey hit/miss counts (Prometheus-friendly endpoint like `/metrics`).

### Observability and tracing
- Structured request logs: log repoKey, upstream URL, cache hit/miss, and latency for each request.
- Tracing RoundTripper: wrap the HTTP client with a RoundTripper that records request/response headers, status codes, and timing — useful for debugging CDN/proxy interactions.
- Distributed tracing hooks: add OpenTelemetry spans around cache lookup, upstream fetch, and blob streaming.

### CDN and network compatibility
- CDN-aware checks: verify responses for `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Range` support so the proxy behaves well behind CDNs.
- Range requests: support `Range` headers for partial blob reads; this improves compatibility with some clients and CDNs.

### Reliability and security
- Graceful shutdown: ensure in-flight writes finish or are rolled back cleanly.
- TLS termination: add optional HTTPS support with configurable certificates.
- Access control: restrict which repoKeys are usable or require auth for the management API.

### Developer experience
- Clearer error messages: surface upstream errors to clients in a way that helps debugging.
- Integration tests: spin up lightweight fake registries (e.g., `oras`, `registry:2` container) to run end‑to‑end checks.
- README updates: document Docker Hub’s `library/` rule and give examples for GHCR/Quay.

### Suggested milestones
1. Short term: dynamic repoKey API, structured logging, configurable cache dir.
2. Mid term: auth passthrough, eviction policies, metrics.
3. Long term: CDN checks, OpenTelemetry tracing, multi‑cloud registry support.
